	The report should describe (concisely) existing work with the aim of 
	
	(1) contextualising the project.
		
		Where does it fit in the bigger picture, why does it exist?

		There are many game engines that already exist but nothing combines ease of use with raw speed.
		
		From Unreal Engine with its complete design versus much lighter weight engines such as LÖVE, there is a very wide range of technologies and techniques at work. There is a definitive gap between large heavy engines and the small and lightweight that I intend to fill. By having many features written into the core engine but keeping a lightweight and easy to use API at the front, it will be possible to quickly learn how to easily prototype games, as well as, achieve excellent real world performance.
	
	(2) point out useful techniques and algorithms that will be employed in the solution. 
		
		How to bind Lua?
		
	(3) analyse critically and compare existing work (e.g., conference and journal articles, pieces of software) that address a (significantly) similar	problem to the one addressed by one’s project.
	
		articles/papers on scripting languages
		pros and cons of each language
			eco system and ease of learning
			ease of implementation
		games that already use languages
		
		A very important part of any game engine is the interface between developer and the inner workings. There are many scripting languages that can be chosen from.
